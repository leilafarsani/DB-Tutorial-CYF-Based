Introduction to databases​

A database is a structured set of data held in a computer. It provides ways to store, 
retrieve and organize information.

Why do we need them?​

In the past few weeks, you stored and retrieved data using files.
This is fine for simple data but it can quickly become an issue
as your application becomes more complex and needs to store and
manipulate more complicated data. For example, imagine you want
to develop the next biggest hotel booking application. You will
need to store the list of hotels available for booking somewhere,
and as you add more features, you will need to save users information, 
the reviews they post for each hotel, but also the bookings each user makes. 
You can see that the data you need to handle can become very complicated,
especially when you need to consider that data are not static, as they
can be updated or deleted. To work more effectively with data, we can
then use a database, which present the following benefits:

A database defines a structure for your data and the relationships between entities
A database provides convenient and performant ways to safely store and retrieve data
A database provides a mechanism to check the validity of your data

Different types of database
There are many different kinds of database and different implementations. 
Sometimes, a database type is a better fit to certain use case or certain problems.
The most well-known database types include relational database, key/value database,
graph database and document database (also known as NoSQL). For this class, we will
focus specifically on relational database as they are the most widely used and supported. 
You can consult DB-Engines to see a ranking of the most used database,
as you can see, there is a lot of them!

Introduction to PostgreSQL
"PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and
extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most
complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the
POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years
of active development on the core platform." (source: postgresql.org)
