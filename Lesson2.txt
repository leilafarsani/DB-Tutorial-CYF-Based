Changing the definition of a table​

Sometimes, you may need to change the definition of a table you created before
without deleting it. Such changes include renaming a table, adding/removing
a column, changing the name of a column, changing the type of a column etc...
The general syntax to perform these operations is:
ALTER TABLE table_name action;

For example, to add a new column to the existing customers table:
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;

To delete an existing column from the customers table:
ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;

To rename the table customers into clients:
ALTER TABLE customers RENAME TO clients;
