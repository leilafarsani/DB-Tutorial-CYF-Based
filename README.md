Introduction to databases
Why do we need them?
Different types of database


A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows easy retrieval and manipulation of the data. Databases are used to store large amounts of information that can be accessed and managed by software applications.

Databases can be broadly classified into two categories: relational databases and non-relational databases. Relational databases are the most commonly used type of database and store data in tables with rows and columns. Non-relational databases, on the other hand, use other data models such as document-based, key-value, or graph-based to store data.

Some common examples of databases include Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra. Databases are used in a wide range of applications such as e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and social media.

The design and management of databases require specialized skills and knowledge, including data modeling, database architecture, query optimization, and security. Database administrators (DBAs) are responsible for managing and maintaining databases to ensure they are secure, efficient, and reliable.

SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and use cases.

SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. SQL databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data, retrieve data, and perform operations like joining tables, filtering data, and sorting results. SQL databases are well-suited for handling structured data and supporting complex queries and transactions.

NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use the traditional relational data model and instead use a variety of data models like document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based to store and manage data. NoSQL databases offer better scalability and performance than SQL databases, especially for large datasets and real-time applications. NoSQL databases are often used for handling unstructured or semi-structured data and supporting fast, distributed, and highly available data access.

Here are some of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

Data Model: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, while NoSQL databases use different data models like document-based, key-value, or graph-based.

Query Language: SQL databases use SQL for data manipulation and query, while NoSQL databases have their own query languages like MongoDB's query language.

Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high traffic more efficiently than SQL databases.

Transactions: SQL databases support ACID transactions, while NoSQL databases often use eventual consistency or other approaches to ensure data consistency.

In summary, SQL databases are a good fit for structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured data and fast, scalable data access. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application or system being developed.
